# JsonLight

This is a minimalist and lightweight Java JSON API<br>
Class and method names are freely inspired from the Google Gson API

I made this up for a strictly minimalist usage of JSON structure,
as well as to improve myself.

This API aims to fully support Json5, which up to this day isn't
done by Gson. I hope it helps you if you want to use Json5.

Please enjoy at will, and credit the author upon usage.
